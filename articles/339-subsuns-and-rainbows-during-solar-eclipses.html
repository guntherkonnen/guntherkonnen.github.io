prevented its detection. Separately, we document a visual observation from the
1977 total solar eclipse of a rainbow that faded, in the last a few seconds
before totality, from as normally multicolored to monochromatic red from water
drops then predominantly illuminated by light from the solar chromosphere. A
similar transition in the final seconds before, and after, totality are

parhelion resulting from the momentary illumination of ice crystals by the
solar chromosphere is still waiting to be observed.">
